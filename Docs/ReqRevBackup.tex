\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{Background}

\quad This game is to being developed as the main project for the SFWR ENG 4GP6 capstone course. This game had been an original concept that never made it out of it's idea developing stage and the development team decided that the game's idea and asthetic would be a great project to make.
\subsection{Goals}
\quad The development team wants to create a enjoyable strategic rogue based game as a personal achivement. This game has a few aspects that have open ended solutions such as map generation and random chance variables that will give us the knowledge of how to make them and improve upon them in the future. We as a development team want to deveope this project so that we can improve our abilities to become excellent game developers and understand the process of creating a video game using the Unity Engine. The Development team wants our audience to have an enjoyable, relaxed experience while playing this game. Roguelikes can usually be very stressful and frustraiting due to its random and trial and error nature, but we wish to change this experience and base it more on long term thinking and reward thoughtful resource management.
\section{Stakeholders}
\quad There are a few stakeholders in for this project.\par
Player -  The Player stake in the game is that they are the ones who are playing and enjoying the game. They are important to take into account as we will need to ask questions like, "Is this portion of the game fun" or "Does this feature benefit the player's understanding of a mechanic". The main concern for the player will be to ensure that the game is fun and understandable. \par
Development Team - The Development Team's stake in the game is that we are the ones who are creating and organizing the game. This project will reflect our knowledge that we have acquired over the course of our university career so we must show that we can develop this game properly and so that it can be improved upon in the future. \par
Instructor - The instructor's stake is that they will have constructive control over the duration of the project. They will provide feedback and give guidance so that the development team can create the best version of their game.\par
Judges - The judges stake is that they will give a review based on merit and specific guidlines. They decide how good the game is and how well it fits the development criteria.
\section{Mandated Constraints}
\quad There are a few constraints that the instructor wants us to follow.

\textbf{Game Developers - }References the four groupmates responsible for creating the game. \par

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\quad There are a few facts about game enviroment the developers made.
\begin{enumerate}[{RF}1. ]
	\item Maps are generated using a psuedo randomly generated seed. It is theortically possible to generate the same map given the same seed.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\quad There are a few assumptions the developers made about the players.
\begin{enumerate}[{A}1. ]
	\item We assume that all users of this product are capable of using a computer and a keyboard. 
	\item We assume that all users of this product will be able to differentiate between their character and the map.
	\item We assume that all users will have an Apple or Windows machine.
	\item We assume that all users have used a WASD + spacebar control scheme before.
	\item We assume that some users have played a some sort of game that uses turn based rules.
	\item We assume that when the user achieves a game over that that specific game is no longer replayable.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Scope of the Work}
\subsection{Existing Inspirations}
\quad There are a few existing game that was are using as inspiration to model our game's mechanics and theme off of.
\begin{enumerate}[{EI}1. ]

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Context of the Work}
\quad There are a motivational factors that the development team will keep in mind when we are developing the project.
\begin{enumerate}[{CW}1. ]
	\item The development team will challenge each feature with the idea of fairness, is the feature implemented fair to the player. The team will as to see if the feature can be accounted for and deflected. If the feature can't be accounted for, will it terminally upset the player causing game breaking moments.
	\item The development team will ensure that the art style, gui and map design is considered clean and clear. The developers will question if features like tooltips, indications and menus are easy to read and that selections are simple for the user to understand.  There should be limit of the clutter on screen, both entity and texture wise.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Standards Requirements}
\quad N/A %touch upon
\section{Project Schedule}
% Include an image or table of the development process of the schedule for the coming year.
\section{Risks}
\quad The following are risks that may be assoiciated with the project
\begin{enumerate}[{R}1. ]
	\item \textbf{The sytem does not dealocate pointers causing a memory leak on the user's computer.} This risk will be minimized by using the C\# Script programming language which has a different garbage collection system. Unless the developers use pointers, there should be next to no dealocation problems.
	\item \textbf{The program will cause physical injury to the user such as causing eye soreness or siezers.} This risk will be minimized by limiting the number of flashing imagery.

\section{Costs}
\quad There may be no costs on the development team unless the team proceeds to purchase \$10 worth of game assest or any other 3rd party software.
\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\quad The Game Developers will try to meet the same coding styles throughout the development process. These styles will include having the same spacing, parathesis format and tabulation. The development team will also attempt to document all trivial functions and describe what each created script does and when it should be used. The Developers will also keep a log book handy between group members as an phyical reference to team meetings and work being completed.
\subsection{Training Requirements}
\quad The Game developers will need to learn a few concepts, languages and how to use a few programs during the course of this project.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Graphic layering and 2d projections} This will be useful for when we try to layer graphics ontop of eachother in a orthographic view. It will help us polish the game better.
	\item \textbf{C\# Scripting Language} This is the primary scripting language that Unity uses for it's games and will need to understood so that each memeber can contribute developing the game.
	\item \textbf{Photoshop} This will be useful for developing any game assests that cannot be found on the Unity assest store. It will be used to develop character sprites, textures and GUI.
	\item \textbf{Unity Interface} Unity is the game engine that we will be using and understanding how the engine works, how to put simple levels and scripts together will be neccissary to complete the project.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Waiting Room}
%display here the functions that will not be included this week during presenting, inlcude the letters infront for clear referencing.
\section{Ideas for Solutions}
\quad The following ideas for solutions to problems that we may face during the course of the project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To solve our graphic layering problem, we will look to many bird eye view games such as Don't Starve or Roller Coaster Tycoon to see how the developers seemlessly layered their graphics in an orthotic manner.
	\item To solve our problem of finding atleast one continous pathway, we will reference Graph Theory to ensure that all maps can be dermined as continous. 
	\item To ensure our game is fair to the player we will look into games that have similar mechanics and try to see which game made their mechanic more fair and less dependant on chance. A few contrasts that we will make will be looking at XCOM vs Mario + Rabbits Kindom battle, FTL and The Binding of Isaac. % More references.
