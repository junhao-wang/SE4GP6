< Players should be motivated to reunite the astronauts with their team, and to keep them alive through the tough journey.
---
> Players should be motivated to reunite the astronauts with their team, and to keep them alive through the tough journey. They might feel frustrated at managing the team or facing a difficult fight, but they should want to keep going because they are invested in the characters or the mystery of the world. While truly sombre moments will be few and far between, they should give the players pause.

> 2.6 Atmosphere
>  
> A World Apart should be filled with intrigue, tension, and occasional levity. While the world of AWA should feel cold and uninviting, the characters in it will be anything but. Each will have their own personality and quirks that accents an otherwise mysterious and unforgiving surrounding. Their colors will be vibrant where the rest of the world isn’t, and the things they say should make them feel human in the middle of an alien world.

> While the world will make use of cold ambience and sombre music to set the tone, the characters will be occasionally accompanied by lighter sounds and motifs. The battles will have brisk but low-key music being interrupted by poignant but not cacophonous sound effects.

< Inside of the combat scene, the player will only be able to perform actions on a handful of objects. These include the other character players, tiles, enemies and bosses. The player should never be able to move through or ontop of any other items in the scene and should not be able to interact with the terrain on the map.. The player does need to select the entity that they are interact with in order to perform the desired action, and the visual que will be given showing that they player can make that selection. The visual que is the red “X” that appears ontop of the desired entity. If the entity cannot be interact with, then it will have no visual que.

Once the menu has been closed, the player will not be able to re open the menu at that node. As such, a prompt to ask if you are ok with this selection is mentioned before the player leaves the shop.

< Implementation wise, this is achieved by taking the cost of all the connections within the minimum spanning tree, and doubling it before applying a 3x multiplier to the result and take that as the total supply to be distributed across the resource nodes of the region . The reason the cost of the connections is doubled is due to the potential for backtracking (dead ends) when traversing a minimum spanning tree.
---
> Supply costs are simply set to 1 between two nodes regardless of node-to-node distance to facilitate gameplay decisions and make strategizing for the overworld less cumbersome. By implementing supply costs in this manner, it is easier for the player to gauge, at a glance, how much supply they will need to reach a given destination. Given the complexity of supply availability( through events and currency), narrative decisions, and navigation choices based on location of combat nodes,  there is no reason to further confound the players with an extra layer of arithmetics for supply cost planning.

Testing the project by using automated tests will allow us to see what items are easily able to be purchased and will allow us to balance the game. The item values will be changed in according to allow some items to me more rare than other, allowing important decisions to be made when selling and buying items. The basic algorithm we will use is:

<         A major of game settings will apply immediately when the game is running and only a few settings will be needed to restart the game. Our group is still unsure of how Unity determines it's resolution or Anti Aliasing settings but we can determine that only those two setting will be needed to restart the game if changed. If any other graphical, UI or audio changes are made to the game, they will be saved on the user's computer. We can ensure this by reading the information from a file that has all of the default settings for the game and then save the changes to that file if changes are made. The number of settings that can be changed are the system's resolution, Anti Aliasing, texture quality, windowed mode, UI size and offeset, master volume, music volume and sound effect volume.

> 12. Sounds and Ambiance
> 12.1 Sound Effects
> The goal of sound effects in this game is mainly to provide a sense of immersion for the players. 
> To achieve this, there are sound effects assigned to every available combat action. There are less sound effects during the overworld phases of the game as the overworld itself is presented in a far more abstract way.The overworld thus rely upon ambient visual clutters and background music to offer a different style of immersion.
>         The sound effects used thus far in the game comes from a sampled collection of pre-recorded audio offered without fees  by Soniss.com and distributed via peer-to-peer networks. Further audio effects may be added to the game as required by new/modified weapons, items, or skills.
> 12.2 Music
>         The music in the game mainly focuses on a desolate or desperate theme as the party tries to find their way across a world that was once familiar, but now unknown to them. The heavy piano notes in the main background musics conveys the feeling of desolation in the ice lands, and adds to the theme of emptiness to the first section of the overworld. Combat music, on the other hand, is more lively albeit with a serious tune.While these music choices convey the overarching themes used for ambiance, certain specific situations within the story may call for music that is of a different or contrary nature to these themes.
>         The background music adapted into the game are composed by I3 and used under license. With the implementation of successive arcs and story chapters, music from other composers may be included.
